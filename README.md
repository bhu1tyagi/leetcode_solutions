# LeetCode Solutions - Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions for problems based on Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in C++. The goal of this repository is to help you understand and learn how to approach and solve different problems from the platform LeetCode.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the solutions for LeetCode problems grouped by their respective topics such as Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and so on. Each solution file is named according to the problem's name on LeetCode for easy reference.

## How to Use This Repository
You can use this repository in several ways:

- Practice: Try solving the problems on LeetCode and then compare your solution with the one in this repository.
- Learn: If you're stuck on a problem, you can find the solution here. Make sure to understand the approach, logic, and implementation.
- Revise: This repository can act as a quick revision guide for Data Structures and Algorithms before an interview.
## Code Structure
Each solution file has the following structure:

- Solution Approach: Summary of the approach used to solve the problem.
- Code: Clean and commented C++ code which is easy to understand.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome. If you've solved a LeetCode problem in a more efficient way, or have a solution to a problem that is not already in the repository, feel free to make a pull request.

## Disclaimer
This repository is for learning and sharing knowledge. Please do not misuse it. I encourage you to solve the problems on your own before referring to the solutions here. Remember, the goal is to learn and grow.
